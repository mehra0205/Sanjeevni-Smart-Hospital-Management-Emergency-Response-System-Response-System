**🛑 Problem Statement – Sanjeevni**

In India and many parts of the world, **hospital systems are overwhelmed, outdated, and disconnected**. Patients face long queues, limited access to real-time doctor availability, and confusion during emergencies. Additionally, blood bank shortages, mismanaged medical records, and delayed ambulance responses can lead to preventable fatalities.

There is **no single unified platform** that:

- Enables **quick and remote patient check-ins**
- Offers **real-time access to hospital resources and staff availability**
- **Streamlines emergency care** like ambulance requests and nearest hospital detection
- **Digitalizes medical records**, queue management, and blood bank access

**🧩 The Core Challenges:**

1. ⌛ **Time-consuming registration and appointment delays**
2. ❌ **Lack of real-time doctor/resource visibility**
3. 📉 **Inefficient management of blood and medical resources**
4. 🆘 **Uncoordinated emergency response and ambulance availability**
5. 📂 **Poor accessibility to personal medical records for patients**

**✅ Goal:**

To develop **Sanjeevni**—a smart, mobile-friendly **hospital management and emergency support web app** that bridges the gap between patients, hospitals, and emergency services through real-time data, intuitive interfaces, and location-aware features.
